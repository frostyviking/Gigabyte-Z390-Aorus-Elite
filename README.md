# This is not a guide, this is just a tribute.
Read up on OpenCore, don't just blind copypasta EFI's, kexts, .plist files, pathces,
when you find them on the wildweb.

Open, read, put some brain's into it, learn something. You owe it to ALL creators, contributors before you.

## BIOS Settings
As per OpenCore guide, nothing dramatic needed to be done.
I have 2 profiles saved in bios.
One stable all core 5.1GHz OC for when i feel like booting up windows to game.
One for macOS with a bit bumped voltages for cpu and ram.
Fan/pump curves adjusted for silence but not to sacrifice cooling.
Active Turbo Ratios are set to 51 for all the cores.
